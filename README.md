# Hot Chicken REST API!

### Purpose:
I am a huge hot chicken fan and I built this app to track all of the chicken I eat and hear about. Feel free to contribute to the repository of hot chickens.

### Setup:
When launching this API locally, please do the following:
```
$ cd hot_chicken
$ . venv/bin/actviate
$ export FLASK_APP=hot_chicken
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

If you run into any issues with those commands, please consult the flask documentation @ https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/
